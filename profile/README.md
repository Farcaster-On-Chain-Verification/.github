# Farcaster On-Chain Verification

We've developed a system that ensures secure identity verification for Farcaster users participating in decentralized networks, enabling authentic identity to be recognized. Our goal is to help build a trusted, Sybil-resistant environment for the community.

## Components
- **attestation-frame-azle**: Facilitate Farcaster account attestation using Frames on ICP decentralized infraestructure.
- **attestation-server**: Attest Farcaster accounts using Ethereum's Attestation Service on Arbitrum One.
- **passport**: Passport allows users to prove their identity through a secure, decentralized UI.
